# Landing-Page
This is a project where I build a complete web page from scratch, based on a visual design provided in two images:

	1.	A full-page mockup of the website.

	2.	A reference sheet with font and color details.

It’s a chance for me to apply everything I’ve learned so far — from layout and styling to structure and responsive design.
